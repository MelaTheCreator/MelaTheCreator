🕯️ **Codex Mechanicae – The Manuscript of the Melacreator**

In the shadow of roaring machines and flickering monitors walks a learner devoted to the High Art of Technology.

I did not enter as a master, but as a novice

with a trembling hand, yet a steadfast will

to decipher the mysteries of code.

📜 **Creeds of the Order**

“A system that understands itself is either divine or dangerous.”

I do not serve fleeting trends,
but strive for clarity, durability, and elegance in my work.


The commandments I honor:

Let code be readable like a manuscript.

Let a tool serve humanity, not fashion.

An error is not a flaw, but a prophecy and must be interpreted.

Automation is the alchemy of the modern age.

🔍 **Current Studies**

I explore the gardens of JavaScript,

experiment with containers of HTML and CSS,

and occasionally conjure the spirits of Figma.

My works are imperfect, yet growing,
like a library that is never complete.

📖 **Artifacts & Constructions**

Within this repository lie the artifacts of my journey:
scripts, libraries, tools 
some useful, others merely warnings.

Most remain hidden in the shadows of the future.

Those who wish to study them are welcome.

Those who can use them are blessed.

Those who wish to improve them — enter the circle of contributors.
